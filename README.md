# **House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a house price prediction model using linear regression. The dataset used was synthetically generated in Python to simulate realistic housing features and corresponding prices. The model achieves an accuracy of 100%, showcasing the predictive power and suitability of linear regression for this problem.

## **Project Structure**
- **Data Generation:** Python scripts were used to generate synthetic data mimicking housing market trends and characteristics.
- **Model Development:** Linear regression was applied to analyze the relationship between housing features and prices.
- **Evaluation:** The model's accuracy was measured using standard metrics, resulting in a perfect prediction rate.

## **Features**
- Generate synthetic housing data
- Train and evaluate a linear regression model
- Visualize insights from the dataset and prediction results

## **Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### **Running the Project**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Run the script to generate synthetic data:
   ```bash
   python data_generation.py
   ```
4. Train the model and get predictions:
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

## **Results**
The linear regression model achieved an exceptional accuracy of 100%, perfectly predicting house prices based on the provided features.

## **Future Improvements**
Although the model performs flawlessly on synthetic data, future iterations could include:
- Testing on real-world datasets for practical applications.
- Incorporating additional advanced algorithms to compare performance.
